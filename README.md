# Dotfiles collection

## What is this

Mostly zsh and neovim config, with some X11 for terminal theming.

## Setup
The dotfiles uses [https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot](dotbot) for dotfiles
management using git submodules, so make sure to have cloned and initialized
all the submodules recursively.

## Usage
Comes with both system and user config.
To install the user config: `./install-user-config`
To install the system config: `./install-system-config` (requires sudo)
Or to install both: `./install` (also requires sudo)
